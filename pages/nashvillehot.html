    <img src="../images/nashvillehot.webp">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 | 3-1/2 to 4-lb. chickens, each cut into 10 pieces (breasts halved)</li>
        <li>1 | tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 | tablespoons plus 4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 | large eggs</li>
        <li>2 | cups buttermilk or whole milk</li>
        <li>2 | tablespoons vinegar-based hot sauce (such as Tabasco or Texas Pete)</li>
        <li>4 | cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 | tablespoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 | tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 | teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 | teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 | teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Optional | White bread and pickles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1 | Toss chicken with black pepper and 2 Tbsp. salt in a large bowl. Cover and chill at least 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Step 2 | Whisk eggs, buttermilk, and hot sauce in a large bowl. Whisk flour and remaining 4 tsp. salt in another large bowl.</li>
        <li>Step 3 | Fit a Dutch oven with thermometer; pour in oil to measure 2 inches. Heat over medium-high heat until thermometer registers 325°. Pat chicken dry. Working with 1 piece at a time, dredge in flour mixture, shaking off excess, then dip in buttermilk mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl. Dredge again in flour mixture and place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Step 4 | Working in 4 batches and returning oil to 325 degrees between batches, fry chicken, turning occasionally, until skin is deep golden brown and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of pieces registers 160° for white meat and 165° for dark, 15–18 minutes. Transfer to a clean wire rack set inside a baking sheet. Let oil cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Step 5 | Whisk cayenne, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika in a medium bowl; carefully whisk in 1 cup frying oil. Brush fried chicken with spicy oil. Serve with bread and pickles.</li>
        <li>Step 6 | DO AHEAD: Chicken can be seasoned 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.</li>
    </ul>
